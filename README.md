# LinearRegression_-_RandomForest
Data Visualization and Manipulation:
The data was visualized to identify patterns and relationships between features.
Manipulations were made to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Modeling Approaches:
Linear Regression: Initially, a linear regression model was implemented. However, it resulted in a high mean absolute error (MAE).
Random Forest: A random forest model was then used, which significantly reduced the MAE and provided better predictions.
Features
Data visualization for exploratory analysis.
Linear regression and random forest models for price prediction.
Error analysis to evaluate model performance.
